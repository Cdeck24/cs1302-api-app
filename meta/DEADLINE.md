## Part 1.1: App Description

> This app is used to assist a user in finding where they can watch their
> favorite movies. It takes their search and uses 2 APIs to pull information
> about the movie and get the most common platforms they can watch it on.

## Part 1.2: APIs

> For each RESTful JSON API that your app uses (at least two are required),
> include an example URL for a typical request made by your app. If you
> need to include additional notes (e.g., regarding API keys or rate
> limits), then you can do that below the URL/URI. Placeholders for this
> information are provided below. If your app uses more than two RESTful
> JSON APIs, then include them with similar formatting.

### API 1 OMDb API

```
http://www.omdbapi.com/?t=Inception&apikey=95c8a566
```
> Limited to 1000 requests per day.

### API 2 - WatchMode API

```
https://api.watchmode.com/v1/title/1120728/sources/?apiKey=ooDknqZZ8bPZHQwGJH4XHffdemFaw48553tdgE2Y
```
> limited to 1000 requests per month.

## Part 2: New

> What is something new and/or exciting that you learned from working
> on this project?

I learned more information on what APIs are, how to search them, and 
how to parse information from their responses.

## Part 3: Retrospect

> If you could start the project over from scratch, what do
> you think might do differently and why?

I would probably do a different type of app because this one 
gave me issues getting the apis to work together properly and 
to fetch the information I wanted.
